StoreHive
=========

## Welcome to StoreHive
StoreHive is a sensor-based data collection information system which allows informal traders or stores (sellers) to create a virtual store which will state the goods and services they're providing as well as provide transactional capabilities on the fly. Users (buyers) will be able to register on the platform and list the goods and services they're looking for (a shopping list of sorts). Once they come within range of what they are looking for they get notified by the app.
